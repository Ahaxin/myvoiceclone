# MyVoiceClone

MyVoiceClone is a small demo project that records a short reference clip from a user and then clones their voice using [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS). The cloned voice can speak English, Mandarin Chinese, or Dutch from a single reference.

## Features

- üìº Record or upload a reference audio sample (CLI or GUI).
- üó£Ô∏è Clone the stored voice and synthesise new speech in English (`en`), Chinese (`zh`), or Dutch (`nl`).
- üñ•Ô∏è Launch a Gradio web UI for an end-to-end experience.
- üíæ Persist multiple speaker profiles for re-use.
- üéõÔ∏è Switch between supported Coqui engines with XTTS v2 selected by default.

## Getting started

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. (Optional) Confirm that your microphone works with the `sounddevice` package.

3. Use the CLI or GUI described below to record a voice and synthesise speech.

> **Note**
> The XTTS model is large (~1.5 GB). The first run may take a few minutes while it downloads.

## Command line interface

The CLI wraps the `VoiceCloneService` class located in `voice_clone/clone.py`.

### Record a reference sample

```bash
python app.py record alice --description "Warm alto"
```

You will be prompted to read a short passage for 10 seconds while the microphone records. The sample is saved under `voices/alice/reference.wav`.

### List stored voices

```bash
python app.py list
```

### Synthesise speech

```bash
python app.py speak alice "‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºåÊ¨¢ËøéÊù•Âà∞ËØ≠Èü≥ÂÖãÈöÜÊºîÁ§∫" --language zh
```

By default the output file is created under the speaker directory. Use `--output` to select a custom path.

To try a different engine (e.g. XTTS v1) supply the `--engine` flag when launching the CLI or GUI:

```bash
python app.py gui --engine xtts_v1
```

### Launch the GUI

```bash
python app.py gui
```

The GUI runs locally (default port 7860). It allows you to record or upload a reference sample, enter text in any supported language, and generate speech. The interface stores the reference sample for later use, so you only need to record once per speaker.

## Architecture overview

- `voice_clone/clone.py` contains the core logic for recording, storing, and synthesising voices.
- `app.py` provides both the CLI and the Gradio GUI that leverage the service.
- `requirements.txt` lists the Python dependencies.

## Limitations & future work

- Recording requires a functional microphone and may need input device selection on some systems.
- The XTTS model performs best with clear, clean reference recordings. Noisy inputs can reduce quality.
- Additional languages supported by XTTS can be exposed by updating `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`.
